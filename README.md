# glex
A game engine written using C++ and Vulkan.

## Implemented features
Features implemented in previous version have to be rewritten because I scrapped OpenGL for Vulkan.
* Basic Vulkan rendering framework
* Scriptable render pipeline (experimental)
* Python scripting (using elegant C++ template)
* GUI

# glex
A game engine written in C++ and Vulkan.

This engine is not finished yet. Some features are not fully implemented, and it still contains some legacy code from OpenGL.

## Implemented features
Features implemented in previous version have to be rewritten because I scrapped OpenGL for Vulkan.
* Basic Vulkan rendering framework
* Python scripting (elegant syntax using C++ template)
* Scriptable render pipeline supporting both C++ and Python (experimental)
* GUI
